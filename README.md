# Stock Market Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains `stock_market_prediction.ipynb`, a Jupyter Notebook that implements a stock market prediction model using historical price data. The notebook explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to forecast future stock prices.

## Features
- Data collection from financial sources (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or other APIs),
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and patterns,
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature scaling,
- Machine learning models for prediction (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM, ARIMA),
- Performance evaluation of models using appropriate metrics.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow yfinance
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock_market_prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```
   cd stock_market_prediction
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook stock_market_prediction.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the analysis and predictions.

## Model Performance
The notebook compares different models based on metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-squared. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

## Results & Insights
- Key insights on stock trends and volatility,
- Performance comparison of various machine learning models,
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual stock prices.
